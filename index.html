  <p1>Pizza dough is a yeasted dough which requires active dry yeast. Make sure the check the expiration date on the yeast package! Yeast that is too old may be dead and won't work.

      You can use all purpose flour instead of the bread flour that is called for in the recipe, but bread flour is higher in gluten than all-purpose flour and will make a crispier crust for your pizza.
      
      Cup measurements can vary depending on how you are scooping the flour (we fluff the flour, lightly scoop it, and level with a knife). So I recommend using a kitchen scale to measure out the flour amounts by weight. This is the only way you'll get a consistently accurate measurement.</p1>

<p2>Pizza Dough: Makes enough dough for two 10-12 inch pizzas

    1 1/2 cups (355 ml) warm water (105°F-115°F)
    1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) of active dry yeast
    3 3/4 cups (490 g) bread flour
    2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (omit if cooking pizza in a wood-fired pizza oven)
    2 teaspoons salt
    1 teaspoon sugar
    Pizza Ingredients
    
    Extra virgin olive oil
    Cornmeal (to help slide the pizza onto the pizza stone)
    Tomato sauce (smooth, or puréed)
    Firm mozzarella cheese, grated
    Fresh soft mozzarella cheese, separated into small clumps
    Fontina cheese, grated
    Parmesan cheese, grated
    Feta cheese, crumbled
    Mushrooms, very thinly sliced if raw, otherwise first sautéed
    Bell peppers, stems and seeds removed, very thinly sliced
    Italian pepperoncini, thinly sliced
    Italian sausage, cooked ahead and crumbled
    Chopped fresh basil
    Baby arugula, tossed in a little olive oil, added as pizza comes out of the oven
    Pesto

    Special equipment:

    A pizza wheel for cutting the pizza, not required, but easier to deal with than a knife</p2>
